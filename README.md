## Ideas, Inspirations, and Comments
This sequencer was inspired by the festive atmosphere at the end of the year, and the fact that I enjoy decorating Christmas trees. The most difficult part was converting from a single-track sequencer (as I practiced in the Chickencer tutorial project) to a multi-track sequencer, where each track produces a different configurable sound. I also spent some time wrapping my head around how Unity and Chuck communicate with each other. Another difficult part was controlling the number of steps in the sequencer according to how many and which trees are active (have at least one ornament). The part that I enjoyed the most was creating a visually appealing and flexible interface, as well as making Christmas songs with the final product.
